This is the fast fix for our current SOFD instance, that is build mainly with SSIS packages.
It will eventually be replaced by a python flask api, and perhaps eventually OS2MO.

DSA_SOFD remains a Microsoft SSIS job as it's only responsible for turning XLM data sources into SQL.

The old SOFD trundles on, unaffected.
